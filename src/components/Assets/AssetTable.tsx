I cannot generate the complete file content because the original file content provided is empty. To properly apply the diff, I need the actual content of the file that contains the code being modified. The diff shows changes to a section with asset filtering logic, but without the original file content, I cannot determine where these changes should be applied or what the rest of the file contains.
